            "question": "Video games are often criticized for promoting violence and aggressive behavior among young players. Critics argue that these games desensitize players to violence, encourage conflict, and increase aggression. Consequently, many suggest these games should be heavily regulated or banned. <br>Which one of these statements, if true, most weakens the above argument?",
            "options": [
              { "text": "Video games are a popular form of entertainment enjoyed by millions of players worldwide." },
              { "text": "Many video games provide players with the ability to choose non-violent solutions in conflicts." },
              { "text": "Studies have shown that violent crime rates have actually decreased in the years following the release of popular violent video games." },
              { "text": "Most video games that feature violence also involve complex stories and deep character development." }
            ],
            "answer": 2,
            "explanation": "The primary concern highlighted in the argument is that video games increase aggression and promote violence among players. Statement C counters this by showing evidence that violent crime rates have decreased following the release of violent video games, undermining the argument."

              { "text": "Sarah might recognize some of the attendees who are not from her department." },

            "answer": 3,
            "explanation": "Sarah assumes she will know everyone at the conference because they work in her department. Option D shows her mistake, as the conference being open to employees from other branches indicates attendees Sarah has not met."

            "question": "The school cafeteria has a policy that if you are under 10 years old, you must be accompanied by an older sibling or parent.<br> <b style='text-align:center'>Dialogues:</b><br> Alice: 'John was eating with his older brother, so he must be under 10 years old.'<br> Ben: 'But Lucy was eating alone, so she must be at least 10 years old.' <br>If the information about the cafeteria policy is correct, whose reasoning is correct?",

            "answer": 1,
            "explanation": "Ben’s reasoning aligns correctly with the policy: since Lucy was eating alone and the policy states that only children who are at least 10 can eat alone, it follows that Lucy must be at least 10. Alice’s reasoning is flawed as children over 10 may still eat with their siblings or parents."
